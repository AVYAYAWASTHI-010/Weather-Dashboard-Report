## 4. Data Source

**Source**: [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/) ‚Äì A free and paid API service offering weather forecasts, air quality data, and astronomical timings.  

Data retrieved includes:
- Current temperature, humidity, wind speed
- 7-day weather forecast
- Sunrise and sunset timings
- Rain probability
- Air Quality Index (AQI) and pollutant levels (PM10, PM2.5, NO2, CO, SO2, O3)

## 5. Features / Highlights

### ‚Ä¢ Business Problem
There is a lack of easily accessible, real-time weather analytics dashboards that integrate environmental factors and pollutant levels for urban planning, health decisions, and individual awareness.

### ‚Ä¢ Goal of the Dashboard
To create a user-friendly, live weather monitoring dashboard that:
- Summarizes key weather parameters across cities
- Provides health-related air quality information
- Offers forecast trends for proactive planning
- Visualizes rain probability to aid travel and event planning

### ‚Ä¢ Walkthrough of Key Visuals

- **Current Weather Tile**  
  Displays city-wise weather (temperature, condition) with city toggle.

- **Forecast Weather (Line Chart)**  
  Shows temperature trend over the next 7 days.

- **Air Quality Index (AQI Panel)**  
  Circular gauge for overall AQI rating (Good/Moderate/Poor) with pollutant-specific values.

- **Rain Probability (Bar Chart)**  
  Horizontal bar chart showing daily chances of rain for the coming week.

- **Sunrise & Sunset Timings**  
  Shows time of sunrise and sunset for the selected city.

- **Weather KPIs**  
  Widgets for:
  - Humidity  
  - Wind Speed  
  - Visibility  
  - UV Index  
  - Pressure  
  - Precipitation  

### ‚Ä¢ Business Impact & Insights

- **Travel Planning**: Users can evaluate rain forecasts and AQI before commuting or planning outdoor activities.
- **Health Awareness**: Helps individuals sensitive to pollution to monitor NO2, PM2.5, and CO levels.
- **City Management**: Urban planners can use such dashboards for environmental monitoring and alert systems.
- **Educational Tool**: Useful in schools and institutions for teaching weather and environmental science with real-time data.
